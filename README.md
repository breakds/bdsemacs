# bdsemacs

The emacs configuration repository.

Run `install.sh` to setup.

## TODO

1.  The default `elpa/` installations will nor work for emacs24 (haven't tested it for emacs25 yet). May need specialization for them. Although a simple way to address this is to just remove `elpa/` and let emacs install all of them and sanity is back.
